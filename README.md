### IDE

Some useful plugins to deal with the actions I recommend are:

- [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) to format GitHub actions and show errors.
- [YAML to JSON](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahebrank.yaml2json) to be able to toggle between YAML and JSON formats easily.
